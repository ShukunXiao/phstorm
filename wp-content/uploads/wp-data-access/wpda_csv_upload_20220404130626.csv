1890 san antonio enchilada sauce,"this recipe is from cook 'em horns published by the university of texas ex-students' association.  it is the only enchilada sauce recipe i use, period.  homemade is always best. i have used a blender, but i don't blend all the tomatoes.  i have also used a potato masher for the tomatoes for a thicker sauce.  cooking and prep time to not include preparing the enchiladas.  serve on beef, chicken, vegetarian...just about any kind of enchilada.","['bacon grease', 'onion', 'garlic cloves', 'whole tomatoes', 'water', 'salt', 'pepper', 'ancho chili', 'chili powder', 'sugar']",60.4,5,14,17,2,6,2
1898 potato dumplings,"from ""the galt cookbook"", published in 1898. i have adapted it slightly, by adding quantities and instructions. to my complete surprise these remind me a little of ""lo bak go"", (dim sum popular at chinese new years.) the good ladies of galt are no doubt rolling in their graves, but i serve these with a good whack of chile-garlic sauce 'cause that's how i like my lo bak go too. these are not the sort of thing to make from scratch, but from the leftovers of a ham-and-potato meal. they are easiest to mix if the potatoes are still warm, so set them on to poach as you clean up after dinner. then, they can be fried up when you want them. keep cakes wrapped in the fridge until ready to fry. they will keep for a couple days, so you don't have to fry all of them at once. i should also note that i use an unsalted smoked ham, so you may wish to reduce or eliminate the salt if your ham is salted.","['mashed potatoes', 'cooked ham', 'egg', 'flour', 'salt', 'baking powder', 'ham fat']",177.8,6,5,18,16,7,8
